             We’re conditioned to link the word “innovation” with flashiness, and it’s to no fault of our own. Mediatic representation that restricts novel ideas to Silicon Valley has exacerbated the “Founder Epidemic,” wherein many chase flashy profitable ideas that supposedly can make them the next Steve Jobs. Innovation, however, spans much further than this one oversaturated category. Ideas like Generative Artificial Intelligence are oversaturated because they’re profitable and grab the spotlight, but there are many areas like Assistive Technologies that actually have a shortage of innovators. I want to encourage people to take a step back from our busy lives and reminisce about our childhood innocence and uncalculated curiosity: when we all asked “Why?” just because.

            My speech challenges the misconception that luck is random chance, and argues that it is something we can actively build on through small actions. By adopting a win-win mindset, forming weak ties, and acting on the principle of “nantonaku”, we create opportunities that later look like lucky breaks. Understanding how luck works comes with a strong responsibility to use it to design opportunities for others as well.
